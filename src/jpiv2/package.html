JPIV particle image velocimetry source code documentation.
Roughly speaking, this package can be devided into two different sorts of classes:<br>
1. Classes forming a user interface for PIV evaluations, image and vector field display.<br>
2. Classes for image analysis and PIV data processing.<br>
<br>
You can make yourself familiar with this package, by just reading the description of the different classes. The full list of classes is provided in the table above. The most important classes are mentioned below to give a first quick overview.<br>
<br>
Important classes of the first category are:<br>
<br>
<b>JPiv</b><br>
This is the main jpiv window. When you start jpiv, a jpiv2.JPiv() object is created and shown on screen. Three child frames are also created on startup and shown, their classes are: SettingsFrame, CmdFrame, and ListFrame.<br>
<b>SettingsFrame</b><br>
An object of this class is used to edit all jpiv settings.<br>
<b>CmdFrame</b><br>
An object of this class is used for displaying system output and for BeanShell scripting.<br>
<b>ListFrame</b><br>
A ListFrame object holds the links to the files, that the user is currently working with.<br>
<br>
Important classes of the second category are Settings, PivData, and PivEvaluation.<br>
<br>
<b>Settings</b><br>
This class is basically a list of all variables used in jpiv. This object is serializable, that means it can be saved to a file and restored from a file.<br>
<b>PivData</b><br>
A PivData object might be created from a file, a list of files or an array of data. A PivData object has a lot of methods to process this data, like normalizedMedianTest(parameters), resample(parameters), or writeDataToFile(parameters).<br>
<b>PivEvaluation</b><br>
This class is performing the PIV image analysis. The actual image correlation is implemented in the class PivUtils.<br>
<br>
<br>
Have a lot of fun!<br>
