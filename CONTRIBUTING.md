# Contribution

You are very welcome to improve JPIV! There are many ways:

## Documentation and Tutorials

Write a HOWTO, send a video, add examples or tutorials. Any material can be incorporated directly into the documentation (docs folder, accessible via GitHub pages: https://eguvep.github.io/jpiv/) or via link (your page, vimeo, ...).

## Beanshell Scripts

Extending JPIV via Beanshell Scripts is very flexible and straightforward. Check the documentation for an introduction and examples: 

https://eguvep.github.io/jpiv/scripting.html

Just send me your scripts and I'll copy them into the library.

## Scripts in other languages

Check out the Beanshell scripts 2example_resample_vector_field.jsc and apply_mask.jsc. They show, how easy it is to integrate virtually any third party tool into the JPIV workflow.

## JPIV java code

Fork this repository, improve the JPIV Java source code and start a pull request! If you would like to improve the GUI, I recommend to set up a Netbeans project. The source includes form files that are used by the Netbeans Form Editor.
